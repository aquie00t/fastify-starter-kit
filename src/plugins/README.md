# Plugins (Fastify Ecosystem Plugins)

This folder is for Fastify plugins that are installed from the ecosystem, such as:

- `fastify-jwt`
- `fastify-cors`
- `fastify-swagger`
- `fastify-cookie`
- `fastify-static`

These plugins are typically third-party libraries registered via `fastify.register()` and provide core framework features.

> ❗ Do not place your custom plugins here. Use the `custom-plugins/` structure for your own Fastify plugins.
